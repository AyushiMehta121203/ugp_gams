**Energy Transition Modeling using GAMS**
Under Prof. Rajeev Jindal

Developed an Energy Transition Model using General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) to minimize cost of electricity generation.
It reduced dependency on grid by integrating renewable sources, like Solar Power, coupled with Storage facilities like Batteries.
Estimated the optimal capacity for the Solar Power Plant by incorporating constraints for charging/discharging and ramping up/down.
Explored multi-objective optimization to simultaneously minimize both electricity generation costs and carbon footprints.
